        How to play <br />
        (Rules of game)
      </h1>
      <h2>Players & Equipment</h2>
      <p>
        Each rugby team will consist of 15 players. The team is split into two
        groups known as forwards and backs.There are 8 forwards (positions
        include Hooker, Prop, Second Row, Flanker and Number Eight) and 7 backs
        (positions include Scrum Half, Fly Half, Inside Centre, Outside Centre,
        Wingers and a Full Back).
      </p>
      <p>
        The pitch is split up into three sections; one main playing area which
        must not exceed 100 metres and two dead goal areas which can range from
        10 to 20 m. The pitch must then be equal to 70 metres wide. The goal
        posts are in an ‘H’ shape and are roughly 5 to 6 meters apart with no
        restrictions on height.Studded boots can be worn along with gum shields,
        head guards, shoulder pads and shin pads. Each team must wear the same
        coloured jerseys with matching shorts and socks.
      </p>
      <h2>
        Rules of <br />
        Rugby
      </h2>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The game is broken down into two 40 minute halves with a 10 minute
          rest period in between. The game carries no stoppage time and will end
          exactly on 80 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Each team can start with 15 players and up to 7 substitutes. Players
          that have left the field are only allowed to return if they have been
          treated for an injury.
        </li>
        <li>
          The field must be roughly 100 metres long and 70 metres wide with a
          minimum of a 10 metre dead ball area. The H shaped goal needs to be 6
          metres wide with no restrictions on height.
        </li>
        <li>
          The game will stop if a player is fouled, the ball goes out of play or
          a try or drop goal is scored.
        </li>
        <li>
          The defending team must tackle a player by grabbing a hold and pulling
          them to the floor. A tackle cannot be made above shoulder height and
          doing so will cause the referee to award a foul.
        </li>
        <li>
          Attacking players must remain behind the ball whilst active or run the
          risk of being called offside. Players not interfering with play can be
          in front of ball but must get back behind the ball before then again
          interfering with play.
        </li>
        <li>
          Once the ball goes into touch a line out is called. Up to 7 players
          can enter a line out and any of these players can be lifted in order
          to catch the ball being thrown in. Both teams can compete to win the
          ball.
