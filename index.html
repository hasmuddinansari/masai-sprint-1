        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Rugby union is a popular sport around the world, played by male and
          female players of all ages. In 2014, there were more than 6 million
          people playing worldwide, of whom 2.36 million were registered
          players. World Rugby, previously called the International Rugby
          Football Board (IRFB) and the International Rugby Board (IRB), has
          been the governing body for rugby union since 1886, and currently has
          101 countries as full members and 18 associate members. In 1845, the
          first football laws were written by Rugby School pupils; other
          significant events in the early development of rugby include the
          Blackheath Club's decision to leave the Football Association in 1863
          and the split between rugby union and rugby league in 1895.
          Historically an amateur sport, in 1995 restrictions on payments to
          players were removed, making the game openly professional at the
          highest level for the first time.

        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          The Greeks and Romans are known to have played many ball games, some
          of which involved the use of the feet. The Roman game harpastum is
          believed to have been adapted from a Greek team game known as
          "ἐπίσκυρος" (Episkyros)or (phaininda), which is mentioned by a Greek
          playwright, Antiphanes (388–311 BC) and later referred to by the
          Christian theologian Clement of Alexandria (c.150-c.215 AD). These
          games appear to have resembled rugby football.The Roman politician
          Cicero (106–42 BC) describes the case of a man who was killed whilst
          having a shave when a ball was kicked into a barber's shop. Roman ball
          games already knew the air-filled ball, the follis. Episkyros is
          recognised as an early form of football by FIFA
        </p>

          Although rugby football was codified at Rugby School, many rugby
          playing countries had pre-existing football games not dissimilar to
          rugby. Forms of traditional football similar to rugby have been played
          throughout Europe and beyond. Many of these involved handling of the
          ball, and scrummaging formations. For example, New Zealand had
          Ki-o-rahi, Australia marn grook, Japan kemari, Georgia lelo burti, the
          Scottish Borders Jeddart Ba' and Cornwall Cornish hurling, Central
          Italy Calcio Fiorentino, South Wales cnapan, East Anglia Campball and
          Ireland had caid, an ancestor of Gaelic football. The first detailed
          description of what was almost certainly football in England was given
          by William FitzStephen in about 1174–1183. He described the activities
          of London youths during the annual festival of Shrove Tuesday: After
          lunch all the youth of the city go out into the fields to take part in
          a ball game. The students of each school have their own ball; the
          workers from each city craft are also carrying their balls. Older
          citizens, fathers, and wealthy citizens come on horseback to watch
          their juniors competing, and to relive their own youth vicariously:
          you can see their inner passions aroused as they watch the action and
          get caught up in the fun being had by the carefree adolescents.
