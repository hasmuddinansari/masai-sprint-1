        <ul>
            <li>1 & 3 Loosehead and Tighthead Prop</li>
            <li>Along with the hooker, the loose-head and tight-head props make up what is known as the front row, which refers to their rugby positions in the scrum.To be successful, both props must be extremely strong in the neck, shoulders, upper body and legs, and they should relish head-to-head competition.</li>
            <li>2 Hooker</li>
            <li>Lining up in the scrum between the two props, the hooker is one of the forwards’ key decision-makers. He or she will coordinate the timing at the scrum, and is also responsible for winning possession in the scrummage by hooking the ball back through the props’ legs.</li>
            <li>4 & 5 Lock/Second Row</li>
            <li>The second row forwards (also known as locks) are the engine room of the scrum and the target men in the lineout, meaning that they need to be tall, powerful players with excellent scrummaging technique and pinpoint timing.</li>
            </ul>
      </p>
    </div>
    <div>      <p id="para2">
        <ul>
            <li>6 & 7 Flanker/Wing Forward</li>
            <li>Flankers are often considered to be the players with the fewest set responsibilities, but as such must be excellent all-rounders with inexhaustible energy. Speed, strength, fitness, tackling and handling skills are all vital.</li>
            <li>8 Number Eight</li>
            <li>Support play, tackling and ball-carrying are the No.8’s areas of expertise, making his or her duties similar to the two flankers. Together the trio forms a unit called the back row.

                    Binding on right at the back of the scrum, the No.8 is also the only player from the forwards who are allowed to pick the ball up from the base of the scrum.</li>
            <li>9 Scrum-Half</li>
            <li>Acting as the link between the forwards and the backs, the scrum-half is the key rugby positions when it comes to building attacks. Playing just behind the forwards, a good scrum-half will control exactly when the ball is fed out to the backs from the rear of a scrum, ruck or maul.</li>
        </ul>

      <p id="para1">
        <ul>
            <li>10 Fly-Half</li>
           <li>The heartbeat of the side and arguably the most influential player on the pitch. Almost every attack will go through the fly-half, who also has the responsibility of deciding when to pass the ball out to the centres and when to kick for position</li>
           <li>11 & 14 Wing</li>
         <li>Playing out wide on the side of the pitch, the winger is a team’s finisher in the attack. A winger is also often the last line of defence when they don’t have the ball and as such, pace is their major resource.</li>
            <li>12 & 13 Centre</li>
            <li>The inside centre – who stands closest to the fly-half when the backs line up – and the outside centre tend to be strong, dynamic runners with a good eye for exposing gaps in the opposition defence. In attack they tend to run very direct lines.</li>
            <li>15 Full-back</li>
            <li>Lining up behind the entire back line, the fullback is the closest thing that rugby has to a sweeper in defence. But they also receive deep kicks from the opposition, so they must be comfortable catching high balls and launching attacks from the resulting possession.</li>
